  1. Download all files
  2. create_files.py exists solely for documentations's sake as the students folder contains 20 students files already. If you wish, you may choose to create new students by running create_files.py
  3. in WSL, run the following (where n denotes the subquestion you want to run):
     "g++ main_2n.cpp -o main"
     "g++ ta_2n.cpp -o ta"
  4. run the following: "./main n", where n is an integer greater or equal to 2 representing the number of TAs.
